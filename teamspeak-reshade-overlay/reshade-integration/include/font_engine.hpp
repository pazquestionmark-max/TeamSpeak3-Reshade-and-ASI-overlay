// A typeface of the overlay's own, independent of ReShade's.
//
// ReShade owns the Dear ImGui font atlas, and that atlas is deliberately absent from the
// function table ReShade exports to add-ons -- reading it is how the font picker crashed the
// game. So this does not touch it. It rasterises a .ttf itself with stb_truetype, uploads the
// result as an ordinary texture through ReShade's device API, and draws glyph quads from it.
//
// Two consequences worth stating plainly:
//   * The font applies to the overlay alone. ReShade's own UI keeps its own font, which is what
//     the user asked for.
//   * Text measurement becomes ours. Widths come from the same advance table the glyphs are
//     drawn from, so right-alignment can no longer disagree with what is on screen.
//
// Every failure path falls back to ReShade's font rather than drawing nothing.
