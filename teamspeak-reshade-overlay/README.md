# TeamSpeak ReShade Overlay

See who is in your TeamSpeak channel, and who is talking, without leaving the game.

A TeamSpeak 3 plugin publishes your channel and its members over a local named pipe; a front end
inside the game draws them in its own render pipeline. There are two front ends — a ReShade
add-on and a standalone `.asi` plugin — and they share everything but their entry point.
Inspired by TSNotifier in purpose, not in implementation — no assets or code are taken from it.

> **Status: the logic is thoroughly tested; the Windows binaries are not yet field-tested.**
> 344 automated tests pass on every push, covering the protocol, state machine, configuration,
> layout, notifications and end-to-end IPC over a real socket, plus cross-validation between two
> independent implementations of the wire format. The Windows build is defined in CI but has not
> been run on hardware by the author, and the overlay has not yet been rendered in a real game
> against a live TeamSpeak client. [`docs/compatibility.md`](docs/compatibility.md) marks every
> configuration **verified**, **expected** or **untested**.

## What it shows

* The current channel, its parent, and how many people are in it — updating the moment you move.
* Everyone in the channel, with who is speaking.
* Microphone mute and speaker mute as **separate** states, never conflated.
* Channel Commander, by default an orange circle immediately before the name.
* Away, recording, priority speaker, locally muted, and suppressed.
* Incoming whispers, shown distinctly from ordinary channel speech.
* Join, leave, channel-change and connection notifications, with fade in and out.
* Channel and server chat, opt-in per category. **Private messages are off by default.**

Every colour, position, size, icon, animation and visibility is configurable in game, per user
and per channel, without editing a file.

## Why an add-on and not a shader

A ReShade effect (`.fx`) is a GPU shader. It cannot open a pipe, read a file, hold a string or
lay out text, so it cannot display a TeamSpeak nickname — no amount of cleverness changes that,
and this repository ships no `.fx` file pretending otherwise.

A ReShade **add-on** is native code loaded into the game process, handed ReShade's own Dear ImGui
context. It can open a pipe and draw text. The always-on HUD uses the `reshade_overlay` event,
which ReShade invokes every frame when an add-on subscribes — verified in ReShade's source, not
assumed. The settings window uses `register_overlay`, which ReShade calls only while its menu is
open. Full reasoning: [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

## Install

Pick one front end. Both show the same HUD and read the same profiles.

**ReShade add-on** — preferred. Needs **ReShade with add-on support** (not the "addon-free"
download).

1. `plugin\tsro_overlay_win64.dll` → `%APPDATA%\TS3Client\plugins\`, then enable it in
   TeamSpeak → Tools → Options → Addons → Plugins.
2. `addon\TeamSpeakOverlay.addon64` → next to the game's ReShade DLL.
3. In game: Home → Add-ons → TeamSpeak Overlay.

**`.asi` plugin** — for people who do not want ReShade. Direct3D 11, x64.

1. The same TeamSpeak plugin as above.
2. `asi\TeamSpeakOverlay.asi` → your ASI loader's plugins folder
   (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\FiveM\FiveM.app\plugins\` for FiveM).
3. In game: press **Insert**.

The `.asi` build gets its frame by hooking the game's DXGI swap chain, which is what a
code-integrity check looks for; an anti-cheat that sees it cannot tell this overlay from
something that is not one, and FiveM servers in pure mode block `.asi` plugins outright. Read
[`docs/asi-plugin.md`](docs/asi-plugin.md) before installing it. Install one front end, not both.

## Layout

```
shared/               platform-independent C++17 core — no TeamSpeak, ReShade, ImGui or Win32
teamspeak-plugin/     Component B: the TeamSpeak 3 plugin (Plugin API 26)
reshade-integration/  Component A: the overlay itself (renderer, settings UI, icons, font
                      engine, host) plus the ReShade add-on's entry point
asi-integration/      Component A's second front end: the standalone .asi (DXGI hook, own ImGui)
tools/config-tool/    tsro-config: defaults, validation, schema probing
tools/tsro-cli/       TypeScript: configuration tooling and the mock-plugin test harness
tests/               C++ unit and integration tests
examples/profiles/   six example configurations, validated in CI; default.json is the one a
                     fresh install is seeded with
docs/                architecture, protocol, configuration, compatibility, testing, troubleshooting
```

`shared/` has no third-party dependency: every byte of it is loaded into someone else's game and
voice client. That is also what makes the state machine, protocol, configuration and layout
testable on any platform, which is why the test suite genuinely runs in CI rather than being
aspirational.

## Design commitments

These are testable claims, not aspirations. Each one is enforced by a test:

* **The renderer never blocks.** All IPC, parsing and state application happen on a background
  thread; the render thread does one atomic exchange against a triple buffer.
* **TeamSpeak's callback thread never blocks.** Events are queued, never written synchronously.
  A stalled overlay causes a bounded queue to drop and resynchronise, not the voice client to
  stutter.
* **Absent is not false.** A state the SDK cannot report is omitted, and the overlay hides that
  indicator rather than rendering a confident wrong answer.
* **A stale user list is never presented as live.** After the configured window with no update,
  the overlay changes presentation and requests a resynchronisation.
* **Chat you did not ask for is never sent.** Categories are filtered inside the plugin, so a
  disabled category never crosses the pipe and cannot be recovered from a trace.
* **Nothing reaches the network.** Neither component opens a socket.

## Development

```bash
cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j && ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
scripts/check-windows-sources.sh          # cross-compile the Windows-only sources with MinGW
cd tools/tsro-cli && npm install && npm test
```

Try the overlay without TeamSpeak running:

```bash
cd tools/tsro-cli && npx tsx src/cli.ts mock --scenario chatter
```

`scripts/fetch-deps.sh` (or `.ps1`) retrieves the pinned ReShade SDK, Dear ImGui and TeamSpeak
Plugin SDK headers. None of them are redistributed here. ReShade and ImGui must be a matched
pair — including ImGui's **docking** branch — and CMake fails with an explanation if they are not.

MinHook is the one exception: it is vendored in `third_party/minhook/`, because the `.asi` build
links it into the shipped binary and a source archive should build on its own.
[`third_party/minhook/UPSTREAM.md`](third_party/minhook/UPSTREAM.md) records the exact upstream
commit, the single file that differs from it, and what that difference requires of callers. Its
